description: Scope control and safety
---

Scope:

- Implement exactly what the task asks.
- Do not perform “cleanup” refactors unless requested.

Risk areas:

- Wallet connection, approvals/permits, signing, network switching, slippage, transaction building.
  In these areas:
- Be extra conservative.
- Prefer existing helper utilities and flows.
- Add guardrails and clear error handling.

Dependencies:

- Do not add or upgrade dependencies unless explicitly requested.
- Avoid modifying `pnpm-lock.yaml` unless dependency changes are necessary.
