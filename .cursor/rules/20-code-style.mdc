description: Code style and architecture
---

TypeScript:

- Use explicit types at boundaries (public hooks, exported utilities).
- Avoid `any`. If unavoidable, isolate it and justify.

React:

- Prefer small composable components and hooks.
- Avoid adding new state managers or heavy abstractions unless requested.
- Keep UI behavior changes local; no cross-app refactors.

Monorepo imports:

- Prefer existing internal package entrypoints rather than deep relative imports across packages.

Formatting:

- Match surrounding file style. Do not reformat unrelated code.
