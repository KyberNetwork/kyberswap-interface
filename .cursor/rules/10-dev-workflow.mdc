description: Dev workflow and commands

Prefer commands:

- `pnpm i`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm type-check`
- `pnpm test` (if present for the package/app you touched)

To run the main app:

- `cd apps/kyberswap-interface && pnpm dev`

If you change code in `packages/`, ensure consuming apps still typecheck.
